## 🛒 Smart Grocery Inventory System

**📌 Project Introduction**

Smart Grocery Inventory System is a web-based application made to manage grocery items in a smart and organized way. This system helps users track grocery stock, check low stock items, monitor expiry dates, calculate total inventory value, and generate bills in PDF format.
This system can be useful not only for home grocery management but also for small shops and local stores.


**💡 Main Idea**

Many times people buy duplicate grocery items because they forget what is already available. Shop owners also face difficulty in managing stock manually.

This project solves these problems by providing a smart dashboard that manages inventory, alerts low stock, tracks expiry items, and generates bills automatically.
